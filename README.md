>Introduction

The Unixorns website is being created with efforts in satisfying a need to better educate those learning Unix based code. Our group divided development efforts into (4) roles in order to accomplish the task at hand. The direction our site leads towards is a self-initiated interest in learning Unix, with a fresh environment and tracking system to help boost productive learning. We approached the issue of stagnated learning when designing our site, and how to better engage user’s attention with the subject. This document will highlight several areas of design content creation along with reference to our group vision for the site.

What is UNIX?
UNIX is an operating system that is most often accessed and used through command inputs in a terminal. It was first developed in the 1960s and has continued to be updated and used ever since. 

By learning how to use UNIX you will become more familiar with UNIX and its derivative operating systems, such as MacOS. This knowledge will give you insight to how operating systems work even if they aren’t directly based on UNIX.

File Structure
	Introduce users to how files are organized on a computer and how files are nested within folders. Explain the pwd and ls commands as well as what “.” and “..” mean in terms of file location.

File Navigation
	Explain the cd command and how one can use the previous commands to move through the files of their computer. Introduce to users the variations in system files that might occur across operating systems.
File Creation and Editing
	Introduction to creating and maintaining files utilizing Unix. This section is a critical step to Unix code and is stressed heavily in teachings. Associated commands and practices regarding file creation taught here with the most focus on mkdir and touch.
File Reorganization
	Introduce users to the usage and syntax of the mv command and the different ways it can be used in conjunction with other previous commands that show the file structure.
Information About Your System
Utilizing Unix to understand and manipulate resources of a machine is a high level function of the Unix community. Operating Systems and structures will be at the core of this section alongside commands to help users realize goals regarding personal computing tasks.

Customizing Your UNIX
File Permissions
	Utilizing Unix to set and change file permissions. This step is very helpful when working with Unix, as it helps a user’s navigation and core structure, and allows the user to manipulate who sees what files. 
What is Shell Script?
	This module would help introduce users to shell scripts, and how they can be used to change their experience when using UNIX on their device.
Starting with Shell Script 
	Starting a shell and compiling using shell scripts. This module would have users use the knowledge gained from the previous module to understand loading the shell with the scripts. 

Running Code
Downloading code
	This would show how users can download code from the Shell
Compiling code
	Explain the use of gcc in order to compile C and Java code directly from the command line interface. 
Makefiles
	Show how to create makefiles and run them in order to accelerate the process of creating code while using UNIX.

Advanced Skills
User Administration
	As an extension of file permissions explain how to change the permissions of different users and how those user accounts can be created differently.
System Details
	

Key UNIX Commands
Navigation
Integral commands that show how to navigate a database or file system using strictly unix commands
Running Files
Integral commands that show how to execute and run files
Miscellaneous
Any other uncategorizable key commands that the user should know, either to use later when learning better content or just as helpful little references.
